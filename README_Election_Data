This is a program that takes files of two election speeches from Kamala and Trump. THe code then removes any junk words (we, them, going, or) and creates a frecuency of words that are used more than 10 times in each speech. These words are sorted and then sent into a different file. TO use the code, you must have the election speeches open as sepreate paper in the same main file as the code. This will allow the code to access the files and run. You will need to change the fhand = open('') part of the code to whatever the file is named to access it. Then when you run the program, it will give you the words and their frequency number next to them.
